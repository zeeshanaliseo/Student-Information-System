# Student-Information-System

Student Information System can be used by educational institutions to maintain their student records easily. Achieving this objective is difficult using the manual system as the information is scattered, can be redundant, and collecting relevant information may be very time consuming. All these problems are solved by this project.
This system helps in maintaining the information of pupils of the organization. It can be easily accessed by the manager and kept safe for a long period of time without any changes
